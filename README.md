# Cropsteering | Growdash
Remix Prism Nodejs Mongodb Tool For Tracking Cropsteering of Plants

## Goal
The goal of this project is to provide a basica set of inputs to track values for optimal agriculture growth of crops. Oftenly reffered to cropsteering.

## Development

Start the development asset server and the Express server by running:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, which will purge the server require cache when Remix rebuilds assets so you don't need a process manager restarting the express server.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```
